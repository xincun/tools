Sucop virus analysis tool(File Format Identifier) v1.4


unnoo-dswlab products


    It is an auxiliary tool for virus analysis, which includes various file format recognition engine code, sniffing packers, unpacking by virtual machine, editing PE file, rebuilding PE file, obtaining the import table(using virtual machine to decode the encode import table), dumpping memory, processesing the overlay, PE address conversion, supporting PEid plugins, computing MD5 and efficient use of third-party tools, and so on. It is also used for disposing the Trojan virus samples during virus analysis.

    This software is free; you can download, install, copy and distribute it noncommercially; For commercial sale, copy and distribute, you should get the warranty and permission of DSWLAB before(for example, if the anti-virus company want to use it to analyses the Trojan horse in batches, he must get mandate and permission of DSWLAB before).
