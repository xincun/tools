Description
===========

DeviceIOView allows you to watch the data transfer between a software or
service and a device driver (DeviceIoControl calls). For each call to a
device driver, the following information is displayed: Handle, Control
Code, number of input bytes, number of output bytes, the name of the
device handle, and all the input/output bytes, displayed as Hex dump.



System Requirements
===================

This utility works on Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and
Windows 7/Vista/2008 (32-bit only). Older versions of Windows are not
supported.



Versions History
================


* Version 1.02:
  o Fixed bug: On some Windows 7 systems, DeviceIOView failed to
    attach a process and crashed it.

* Version 1.01:
  o DeviceIOView now automatically stops when the process that you
    inspect is terminated.
  o DeviceIOView now remembers that last sort in select process
    dialog-box.

* Version 1.00



Using DeviceIOView
==================

DeviceIOView doesn't require any installation process or additional dll
files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file -
DeviceIOView.exe After running it, select the process that you want to
inspect, and click Ok. After clicking Ok, DeviceIOView will start to
display the information about all calls to device drivers.

The upper pane displays the list of all device drivers calls. When you
select an item in the upper pane, the lower pane displays the
input/output bytes, as Hex dump.



Using DeviceIOView In Windows Vista
===================================

DeviceIOView can work in Vista even when UAC (User Account Control) is
turned on, as long as the process that you wish to inspect run in the
same account and security context of DeviceIOView. However, if you want
to inspect a process that runs under administrator account, you must also
run DeviceIOView as administrator. (right-click on DeviceIOView.exe and
choose 'Run As Administrator')



Practical Example For Using DeviceIOView
========================================

Process Explorer of Sysinternals/Microsoft uses a device driver to
extract handle information of any process. If you set the lower pane of
Process Explorer to Handles list, you can watch all the device driver
calls made to PROCEXP100 device driver:




Translating DeviceIOView to other languages
===========================================

In order to translate DeviceIOView to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run DeviceIOView with /savelangfile parameter:
   DeviceIOView.exe /savelangfile
   A file named DeviceIOView_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   DeviceIOView utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
   (TranslatorName and TranslatorURL values) If you add this information,
   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
4. After you finish the translation, Run DeviceIOView, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run DeviceIOView without the translation, simply rename
   the language file, or move it to another folder.
