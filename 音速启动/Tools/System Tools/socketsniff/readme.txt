Description
===========

SocketSniff allows you to watch the Windows Sockets (WinSock) activity of
the selected process.
For each created socket, the following information is displayed: socket
handle, socket type, local and remote addresses, local and remote ports,
total number of send/receive bytes, and more. You can also watch the
content of each send or receive call, in Ascii mode or as Hex Dump.

This utility works on Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003,

Using SocketSniff
=================

SocketSniff doesn't require any installation process or additional dll
files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file -
SocketSniff.exe
After running it, select the process that you want to inspect, and click
Ok. You must select a process that already loaded the winsock library,
otherwise, the action will fail. After clicking Ok, SocketSniff will
start showing the activity of Windows socket for the selected process.
The upper pane displays the list of all created sockets. When selecting a
socket in the upper pane, the lower pane displays the receive and send
calls of the selected socket.



Using SocketSniff In Windows Vista
==================================

SocketSniff can work in Vista even when UAC (User Account Control) is
turned on, as long as the process that you wish to inspect run in the
same account and security context of SocketSniff. However, if you want to
inspect a process that runs under administrator account, you must also
run SocketSniff as administrator. (right-click on SocketSniff.exe and
choose 'Run As Administrator')



Translating SocketSniff to other languages
==========================================

In order to translate SocketSniff to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run SocketSniff with /savelangfile parameter:
   SocketSniff.exe /savelangfile
   A file named SocketSniff_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   SocketSniff utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
   (TranslatorName and TranslatorURL values) If you add this information,
   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
4. After you finish the translation, Run SocketSniff, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run SocketSniff without the translation, simply rename
   the language file, or move it to another folder.
