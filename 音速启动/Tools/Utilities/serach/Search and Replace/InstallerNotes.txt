Installation Notes:

1. All files are installed in the path of your choice. No changes
are made to your 'system' subdirectory.

2. By design this installer does not change any default Search and
Replace settings you may have in place. If you need to wipe all
current program settings please write support@funduc.com and we
will send you separate instructions. Of course this does not apply
to the shareware time out. If your version has timed out please
purchase a registered copy. Thanks.

3. If you use a language module you can download an interface at
any time from our web site. Go to www.funduc.com or
www.searchandreplace.com, scroll down to 'International Versions'
and follow the links from there.

Thanks.
