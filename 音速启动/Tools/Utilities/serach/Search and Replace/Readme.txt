Thank you for purchasing Search and Replace!

PLEASE NOTE: While Search and Replace allows replacing in binary
files (such as .DOC, .XLS etc), these proprietary format files may
contain internal counters which may get out of synch when changed
with an external program.  As a result, the application that
created the file may not be able to read it. For best results,
replace in ASCII text files (such as .HTM, .RTF, .TXT, .INI, .C,
.CPP, .H etc).  In particular, Word files should be converted to
RTF format which can be safely processed.  For replacing in
shortcuts or the registry, see our new utilities at
http://www.funduc.com.  For Word file replacement, see the WordSR
freeware on our website.

  characters. 
- The Windows 95/NT version allows View Context of binary files 
  through a new Freeware utility: HexView.  HexView can be 
  downloaded from http://www.funduc.com.  It should then be 
  installed in the same directory as Search and Replace(or in the 
  path or the Windows dir.). 
- Scripts can be created to specify multiple search/replace 
  combinations (with associated settings) and/or multiple paths and 
  masks to process.  The script settings (masks, paths, 
  search/replace strings) can also be overridden from the main 
  screen. 
- Exclude masks can now be used.  For example: 
  *.*;~*.swp;~*.exe;~*.dll will process all but *.swp;*.exe;*.dll 
  files.
